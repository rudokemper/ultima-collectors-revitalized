# Ultima Collectors Guide - Revitalized

This project is a modernized revitalization of the classic [Ultima Collectors Guide](https://www.ultimacollectors.info/) originally created by **Holger Bachert**. 

Their comprehensive collection documents the rich history of the Ultima series of computer role-playing games across countless platforms and editions. This modernized version presents the same information in a more accessible, mobile-friendly format with improved navigation and contemporary web standards.

To generate this content, I used a few Python scripts to download the HTM files and images from the original website, and recreate them here. Out of respect for the original author, I have not included the scripts or original HTM files in this repository.
