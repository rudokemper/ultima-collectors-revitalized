                                with each copy. The game was released under the 'Sierraventure' label and came in an
                                over-sized box (about 9x11.5" / 23x29 cm) that contained the nicely printed game manual
                                as well as the huge cloth map.
                                The manual contained in the first editions was of slightly different design and of a
                                more glossy, black &amp; white print than those from later releases. It was accompanied
                                by an error correction flyer indicating that this is indeed one of the first prints.

                                systems in much smaller, cheaper looking boxes (6.5x9" / 17x23 cm) that had the new
                                large Sierra logo on the front cover. All documentation was shrinked to a small booklet
                                that varies a bit for each system.
                                There are two distinctive box variations - the earlier one has a quote by Softalk
                                Magazine on the back, later editions feature a line from A+ Magazine and have an
                                additional "50000 copies sold" SPA sticker on the front. This release usually contained
                                the smaller, nylon-made cloth map without any logos (40x30 cm / 16x12").</div>

                                manuals (translated) as well as the cloth map (very different from the original). There

                                indicating either DD or HD version of the game. However, the included diskettes are

                                from later packages. The material feels synthetic and soft and the actual print is very
                                blurry and of a more reddish tint (although this varies). Ultima IV was the first Ultima
                                that came with an additional trinket - a small metal ankh.</div>

                                The box design is similar to the Ponycanyon releases but features complete new artwork

                                system in 1991. The game was fully localized and redesigned for this system (it comes on
                                CD) and is the first Ultima that offers fully digitized speech for all dialogues. The
                                box design is similar to the Ponycanyon releases but features complete new artwork and
                                its content differs considerably from previous releases - it comes with a new set of
                                manuals and without any of the trinkets. Just like other parts of the series for the FM
                                Towns it contains a card board map (green monochrome) and a poster (showing a winged
                                gargoyle) but also a cloth map similar to the original.</div>

                                for all editions (disk, CD) - pentagram on front cover, just like the US disk release.
                                The game itself was fully localized for France, Germany and UK including manuals, ingame
                                speech (or separate speech packs) - the CD-ROM edition contained all three languages.
                                The overall print quality of the documentation and especially the map was poor (and also
                                of slightly different make).</div>

                                developed a 3D engine that not only allowed free movement in all directions but also
                                attempted to combine that with traditional roleplaying features.</div>
